# ITS-Swift-Team-Fall-2022
This repository tracks the development for a iOS quiz app. 
So far we've been using the latest version of Swift (5.7), Xcode version 14.0.1 and build it on any IOS device. 

## Setup
**App:** Download the latest Swift and Xcode version. After downloading both, clone this repo as a project and save it. After that, change the build device to ios device.

**Database:** We used a MongoDB Atlas cluster to store the generated questions and answers. To access the database, download MongoDB Compass [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass). Since this is a cloud-based database, there is no need to download mongo itself. Connect to the database with the connection string:

- `mongodb+srv://quizAppMobileUser:xkLaBBaa1dTsZuX8@quizappdb.7ltdg.mongodb.net/test`
